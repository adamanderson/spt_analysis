This directory contains data from the following simulations of detector gain variation:

1.) No gain variation - Simulated maps from healpix are injected into flat sky maps and fit to powerspectra.
sim_cl_bias_none.pkl - Contains bandpower estimates
none_lensed_cmb_lmax7000_nside8192_interp0.3_method1_pol_1_sim_*_lensed_map.g3 - Contains simulated flat sky maps

2.) Linear gain variation of 2.67% per deg (20% over full field)
sim_cl_bias_linear_2.67.pkl - Contains bandpower estimates
linear_lensed_cmb_lmax7000_nside8192_interp0.3_method1_pol_1_sim_*_lensed_map.g3 - Contains simulated flat sky maps with linear bias
